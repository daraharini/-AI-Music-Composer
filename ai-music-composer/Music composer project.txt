Here are **ONLY the exact commands** you need, **in the exact order**, and **where to run them** — *nothing extra*.

---

# ✅ **STEP 1 — Open the project folder**

Open **PowerShell** inside your project:

```
PS C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\ai-music-composer>
```

If you're not in the folder, run:

```
cd "C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\ai-music-composer"
```

---

# ✅ **STEP 2 — Install required libraries**

Run this **in PowerShell**:

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

(You already installed them, but this is the command.)

---

# ✅ **STEP 3 — Run the FastAPI server**

Inside the folder where the code file exists (**ai_music_composer.py**):

Run:

```
uvicorn ai_music_composer:app --reload
```

---

# ✅ **STEP 4 — Open API UI**

After the server starts, open this link in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

This is the **FastAPI auto-generated UI**.

---

# ✅ **STEP 5 — Test the API**

Inside the UI:

1. Click on **POST /compose**
2. Click **Try it out**
3. Enter:

```
{
  "length": 16,
  "start_note": "C"
}
```

4. Click **Execute**

You will see the generated melody.
